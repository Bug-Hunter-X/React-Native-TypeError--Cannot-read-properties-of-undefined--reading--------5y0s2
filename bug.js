This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined. This commonly happens when dealing with asynchronous operations where the data might not have loaded yet when you try to use it.  For example:

```javascript
// Incorrect
const name = this.state.user.name;
```

If `this.state.user` is null or undefined, accessing `.name` will throw a TypeError.

Another common scenario involves accessing properties from an array before checking the array's length:

```javascript
const firstItem = this.state.items[0]; // Error if items is empty
```
