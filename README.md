# React Native TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')`. This error arises when attempting to access a property of an object that is currently undefined or null.  This often happens when dealing with asynchronous operations where data might not have been fully loaded yet.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version demonstrating how to handle this error effectively.

## Problem and Solution

The core issue is prematurely accessing object properties before verifying that the object and its properties exist.  The solution involves implementing proper null checks and carefully managing asynchronous data fetching.
